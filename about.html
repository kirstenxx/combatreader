<p class="about">Combat Reader is a web based (and potentially smartphone based) speed reading application, developed for the 2017 Commandant's Innovation Challenge - www.combatreader.com<br>
<br>
Combat Reader is a cutting edge tool to foster battlefield readiness in the Information Age by improving Marines' reading and comprehension. Combat Reader has the potential to improve Marines' reading skills, their overall experience with reading, and subsequently their volume of learning.  Many of today's Marines are entering the force with poor reading skills, and most new recruits are accustomed to receiving their information in digital format rather than paper-bound publications. The amount of reading that USMC training and education courses require  can seem overwhelming, and a Marine can easily get trapped in the "vicious circle of the weak reader,” where poor reading skills lead to poor comprehension, lack of satisfaction in the reading experience, and consequently little motivation to engage in further reading<sup>1</sup>.<br>
<br>
Most of us read at about 200 words per minute, about the same rate as we can read a passage out loud.  Combat Reader works by minimizing (or for advanced readers, eliminating) subvocalization, which is the voice in your head that talks as you read...probably what you are doing right now!  This application reduces fatigue, eye fixation (concentrating on only 1 word at a time), and regression (unconsciously going back to words you just read).<br>
<br>
By increasing reading speed and audience engagement, Combat Reader can make professional reading requirements more palatable and less time-consuming.  In 2015, Kwon and Linderholm found that a student's self-perception of reading speed is highly correlated with their self-perception of reading skill, despite the study's finding that actual reading speed is poorly correlated with actual reading skill <sup>2</sup>. What this tells us is that Marines who merely perceive their reading speed as having increased will consequently perceive their overall reading ability to have improved as well. The growth in confidence in reading ability can lead to improvement in the Marine's overall reading experience and an increased amount of reading that the Marine will choose to engage in on their own.  A more knowledgeable and confident Marine in the classroom is a bolder and more decisive small unit leader on the battlefield.  This is truly an innovative and exciting tool to help all Marines develop a 5,000 year old mind, particularly those from the millennial generation.

<h2 class="section">How  </h2>
<div class="about1">
<p class="about">In White Letter 4-12, General Amos articulated his frustration that, contrary to our storied intellectual history, the Marine Corps has slowly become an organization that does not value reading.  In his Message to the Force 2017, General Neller directed Marines to "Commit to reading more" and to take our professional reading to "another level." Unfortunately, many Marines enter the force with poor reading skills, and most new recruits are accustomed to reading digitally rather than through paper-bound publications. Combat Reader is a pioneering solution for any Marine at any command to use, and it would be particularly useful at training commands or professional military education courses that have voluminous reading requirements.  Important communications such as the Commandant's Message to the Force 2017 "Seize the Initiative", the Commandant's White Letter 2-17: Social Media Guidance, or MARADMINS could also be loaded into Combat Reader for Marines to instantly receive guidance from USMC Headquarters.  With very little time and money this beta website could be turned into a mobile app for Marines to download for free on their smartphones.  Marines could read at 3 times their normal speed while standing in line, waiting for the bus, eating chow, or in any clime and place where it is difficult to carry hard-copy books.
	<br>
<br>
In other words, Combat Reader makes learning continuous.  Combat Reader also engages the natural competitive spirit – Marines reading at 250 words per minute will be motivated to increase to 300 or 500 words per minute.  This application provides metrics for success and improvement in ways that traditional reading does not.<br>
<br>
Combat Reader works by accelerating the visual cortex and associated learning processes that a reader's brain has already developed. British researchers found that the segments of the brain that recognize words activate at the same time as the segments that control language and speech motor functions<sup>3</sup> . In 2009, Neuroscientists at Georgetown University found that the brain recognizes words as whole units, and does not confuse words that look similar but are different (e.g. "clip” and "slip”)<sup>4</sup>. A 1999 study found that speed reading does not detract from comprehension<sup>5</sup>. An application like Combat Reader works naturally with the brain's processing of written text and makes Marines more focused, attentive, and efficient as they learn.<br>

<h2 class="section">Why  </h2>
<div class="about1">
<p class="about">Reading is a fundamental building block in the education of Marines.  MCWP 6-11 teaches that "[p]rofessional education and reading combined with stressful, realistic training are critical to building the mental experience that leaders can use to recognize patterns, see similarities between experience and new situations, and make rapid decisions in ambiguous situations<sup>6</sup>. \” Reading is of course paramount in Information Age warfare, as Marines are increasingly employing new concepts and systems that require frequent and rapid reading to master. The Harvard Business Review assessed that "[g]eopolitics, business, industries, and jobs are changing so rapidly that it's impossible to predict the capabilities employees and leaders will need even a few years out<sup>7</sup>. \” One of the hallmarks of a successful force in the Information Age is the ability to adapt by learning, both at the individual and institutional levels. Professional reading is the primary method of how we accomplish this learning as Marines.
<br>
<br>
With so many requirements competing for a unit's training time, any tool that can leverage technology and maximize training hours is a huge asset to a commander.  Combat Reader can not only condense training time, but it can also improve morale by enhancing an important life skill for every Marine, and especially for young Marines by engaging them on the familiar digital platform.  Most humans read at about 200 words per minute, but a Marine can easily triple that with just a little practice on this application.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the Combat Reader enhances the most important weapon of our small unit leaders, their mind.  A more knowledgeable and confident leader makes better decisions under stress and reinforces our Maneuver Warfare mindset that relies on \"rapid and opportunistic decision-making and action.\”

<div class="about1">
<p class="about">Major David R. Dixon and Major Julio C. Gonzalez developed this web based (and potentially smartphone based) speed reading application in response to the 2017 Commandant's Innovation Challenge. This website is currently in beta form – we encourage constructive suggestions and comments. <br>
<br>
Major David R. Dixon is a Marine Corps AH-1W Cobra pilot, and he serves as the Current Operations Officer at 4th Marine Aircraft Wing.

David has also published essays and letters in a variety of sources such as the Marine Corps Gazette, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post.  He coauthored two case-studies that were published through Harvard Business School, and he coauthored an award winning research paper titled Making Good Instructors Great: USMC Cognitive Readiness and Instructor Professionalization Initiatives.  David has completed Expeditionary Warfare School, and he was the Distinguished Graduate of his Command and Staff seminar (distance education programs).
